# critlib-tweets
I've used Ed Summers' [twarc](https://github.com/edsu/twarc) to collect [#critlib](https://twitter.com/hashtag/critlib?src=hash) tweets. twarc generates a JSON file, which I then convert to CSV using twarc's json2csv script. Files are named with the date when I grabbed the tweets; twarc grabs a week's worth of content at a time.
